Introduction
------------

MidGotchi File Commander (in abbreviation - MFC) is a user shell with
text-mode full-screen interface.  It can be run on the OS console,
in xterm and other terminal emulators.

MFC allows you to manage files while making most of
you screen and giving you a clear representation of the filesystem, yet
it's simple enough to be run over a telnet or ssh session and commiting your repos. (in future)

MFC is released under the GNU General Public
License version 3 or any later version.  A copy of the file is
included with this distribution package.
